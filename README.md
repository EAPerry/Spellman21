# Green Commercial Development within Urban Environments: Theory & Evidence

The research objective is to explore and explain the spatial distribution of green commercial buildings within cities by firrst developing a spatial equilibrium model for commercial green development and then testing the model's prediction.

In this repository I have my weekly presentations, my final presentation, and my poster, all with their LaTeX code. I also have some important R scripts and much of the data I was working with over the summer. There are a few data files that I do not have in the repository, either because the files are too large or because the data was not originally publicly accessible (the cellphone data from SafeGraph). Still, the final point level and tract level data are here.
